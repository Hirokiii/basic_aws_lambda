## TODO:
- [x] Enable to do GET method and it returns JSON.
- [x] Let that GET method cope with parameters.
- [x] Enable to do POST method and it returns something.
- [ ] User can send data with that POST method.
- [ ] Lambda function fetches data from DynamoDB upon a call.

## What I want to do
- [ ] Static website on this github pages can call Lambda and do something related to DynamoDB.
- [ ] All processes such as integration and deployment are automated (CI/CD).
- [ ] Connect github actions to Slack.
- [ ] Use Vue in front
